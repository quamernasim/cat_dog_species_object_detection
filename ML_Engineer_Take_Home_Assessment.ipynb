        "- You need to use Google Collaboratory to run and edit this notebook\n",
        "- You can only use Python as a programming Language\n",
        "- You cannot take help from any other person\n",

        "    - Either from PyTorch (torhvision) or any resource online\n",

        "  - Model needs to detect one object in each image\n",

        "      - The bounding box output format should be xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax\n",
        "      - It is not necessary the model is trained to output exactly this format but the visualize function which shows output should output in this format\n",
        "    - Either the object is a cat or dog?\n",

        "  - Select the metrics carefully, there are many scenarios which can change the selection of a metric\n",
        "  - Keep in mind there are multiple outputs, you would need a metric for each output\n",
        "  - [NOTE] You don't need to implement metrics for the bounding box output as it can take more time than provided for this assessment. But please add details of the metrics you would have implemented in your code-walk through loom video.\n",
